# HTMX Template

This is an example of using the HTMX library.
It uses a Node/Express server.
All of the HTMX is in the `/public` .html files.

There are several examples:

- `request.html`: Simple demonstration showcasing event triggering, request handling, target setting, and more.
- `profile.html`: Easily edit your profile by clicking on it.
- `validation.html`: Inline validation example;
- `search.html`: A user-friendly contact search widget;
- `temperature.html`: Simple temperature converter;
- `polling.html`: Example of polling (making a request every X seconds) using a mock weather api;

## Usage

```bash
npm install
```

Open the html page (for example: http://localhost:3000/temperature.html)
